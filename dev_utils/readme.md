* Graphs a rocket's distance with any specified fuel efficiency. You can easily modify anything at the top of the file. 
* If you want to know whether your new rocket engine mod would be OP, look no further.
* Useful for playing with rocket mechanics: Fuel Efficiency, Weight, etc.
* Equations obtained from Assembly-CSharp.RocketStats.GetRocketMaxDistance 
* Thanks to [oni-assistant](https://oni-assistant.com/). It's a web app version of this.
