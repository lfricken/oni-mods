### Installation
1. Install [ONI-ModLoader](https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader#installation).
2. [Click here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/lfricken/oni-mods/tree/master/mod-bin) to download all my mods via DownGit.
3. Move the _unzipped_ Mods folder to the game's root directory which is, by default for Steam: 
    * C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\OxygenNotIncluded
4. The directory tree should look like this:
    * .../OxygenNotIncluded/
        * Mods/
            * SomeMod.dll
            * AnotherMod.dll
5. To uninstall a mod, just remove it's dll file from your Mods folder.

Note that you can optionally put the dll's in subdirectories. As long as the dll files are somewhere inside Mods.
