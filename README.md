1. Install [ONI-ModLoader](https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader#installation).
2. Download dll files from the [mod-bin folder](/mod-bin).
3. Create a Mods folder in the game's root directory which is by default for Steam: 
* C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\OxygenNotIncluded
4. Place those dll files inside the Mods folder.

The directory tree should look like this:

Note that you can optionally put the dll's in subdirectories. As long as the dll files are somewhere inside Mods.
