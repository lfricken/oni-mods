2. Move the _unzipped_ folder to the game's local mods directory which is: 
    * Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\local
3. The directory tree should look like this:
    * ...mods\local\
        * Mod1\
            * Mod1.dll
4. To uninstall a mod, just remove it's dll file from your Mods folder.

Note that you can optionally put the dlls in subdirectories. As long as the dll files are somewhere under the Mods directory.
