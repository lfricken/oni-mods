## About
The Geothermal Steam Pump can be found under the [Plumbing](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Plumbing) tab.
Produces 100kg/s of [Steam](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Steam) at 175 degrees, providing a large amount of water if you can deal with the heat!
The catch is you can't turn it off.
