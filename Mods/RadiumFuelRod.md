## About
* Adds a Nuclear Fuel Rod building under the [Power](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Power) tab.
* It must be constructed out of [Radium](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Radium).
* Emits 8128kw (8 Megawatts) of heat, twice as much as a [Liquid Tepidizer](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Liquid_Tepidizer)
* Use this heat to [convert Petroleum at 400&deg;C](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Crude_Oil) or generate Steam for a [Steam Turbine](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Steam_Turbine).
* [Radium](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Radium) can now be made at the [Molecular Forge](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Molecular_Forge).
* If the Nuclear Fuel Rod overheats it will explode into ball of hot gas.
