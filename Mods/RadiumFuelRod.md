## About
* Adds a Nuclear Fuel Rod building under the [Power](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Power) tab.
* Use this heat to convert [Petroleum](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Petroleum) at 400°C or generate [Steam](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Steam) for a [Steam Turbine](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Steam_Turbine).
* Overheats at over 8000°C.
* If the Nuclear Fuel Rod overheats it will explode into ball of hot gas.
* It must be constructed out of [Radium](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Radium).
* [Radium](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Radium) can now be made at the [Molecular Forge](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Molecular_Forge).
