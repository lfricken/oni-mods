# Rocket Overhaul

## About
The normal ONI rocket equation means that the rocket with the best fuel is always the rocket you should use, and that [Oxylite](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Oxylite) is useless after you can manufacture [Liquid Oxygen](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Liquid_Oxygen). This mod:
* Adds a new Methane Engine which is even more powerful than the [Hydrogen Engine](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Hydrogen_Engine).
* Gives a reason to use different engines under different circumstances.
* Mixing [Oxylite](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Oxylite) _and_ [Liquid Oxygen](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Liquid_Oxygen) it a 1:1 ratio gives the largest boost to efficiency, providing a reason to make both.
* Makes it possible for the best rockets to return more mass via [Cargo Bays](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Cargo_Bay) then it costs to launch it.
* Makes Boosters useful instead of [useless](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/97074-solid-booster-useless-solved/).
* The first Booster provides +30,000km, then +20,000km, +10,000km, and then none.
* Overhauls the StarScreen

## Old Equation
Notice a [Hydrogen Engine](https://oxygennotincluded.gamepedia.com/Hydrogen_Engine) is the best rocket no matter what?

## New Equation
Notice the _best_ rocket depends on how much you want to invest.
