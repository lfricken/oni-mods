# Geothermal Steam Pump

## About
* Adds a Geothermal Steam Pump building under the Plumbing tab.
* Produces 30kg/s of Steam at 175°C.
* This provides a large amount of water if you can deal with the heat!
* Does not require an operator.
* The catch is you can't turn it off.
* You probably need to be in Space Tech to handle the heat.

## Is this OP?
### As a heatsink?
You could always use Aquatuners and water for a great heatsink. Using Thermium Aquatuners and venting steam to space, you can heat up water to 900°C and then vent it. This consumes a tiny amount of water for a ton of heat. So a great heat dump already exists in the game.

### As a power source?
You still need to heat the water up by 50°C. So this would be decent if combined with Lava. But compare the difficulty of that setup to Boiling oil. If you want to put this thing near Lava, where will you pump the excess steam? If you pipe the steam from the top of the base, that's a logistical challenge. Boiling oil from a single oil geyser is +30,000kw (15 steam turbines). So a great power source already exists too.

### As a water source?
The real benefit comes from infinite water. This still costs a lot of power as you have to drop the temp of the water by 125°C, which takes a lot of power through Aquatuners.
