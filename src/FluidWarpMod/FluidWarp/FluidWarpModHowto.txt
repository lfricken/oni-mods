* The stargates look like valves and are in the plumbing and ventilation menus.

* Place one providing input fluid, and another one with an output pipe. (Do not plug both (input/output) pipes in the same gate).

* Use the Channel slider in the Stargate Menu to tune both to the same channel.

* Channel 10000 has special meaning - building it disabled in this channel, to avoid waisting gas/fluid to default channel when built.

* The fluid is stored in a up to 100 kg for liquid and 50 kg for gas (per channel). This storage is deleted where you exit the game.

* You can place two stargates with one input each and one stargate with one output pipe then as example:
two inputs send two packets of 1kg and 2kg, then the ouput will put in the pipe two packets of 1kg and 2kg sequentially.
